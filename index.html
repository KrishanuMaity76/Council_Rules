<p>​(2) Filing the signed original of the measure with the Secretary during normal business hours.</p>
<p>​(b) Unless a law specifically provides otherwise, no matter transmitted for a period of Council review before taking effect shall be deemed transmitted to the Council or the Chairman, and no time period for Council review shall begin to run until the matter has been formally introduced by the Chairman pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>

<p>(a)(1) When a measure is introduced before a legislative meeting or Committee of the Whole work session, the Chairman may refer it to the appropriate committee or committees, taking into account standards of germaneness, unless the Council retains the measure. The referral is official unless the Chairman provisionally refers the bill to a committee or committees.</p>
<p>​(2) If the Chairman provisionally refers the bill to a committee or committees, the referral shall be deemed official after 3 business days.

The Chairman may refer a bill or proposed resolution for comments at any time.</p>
<p>​(b) When a bill is introduced by filing it with the Secretary, rather than introducing it at a meeting pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Chairman shall refer it to the appropriate committee or committees.

The withdrawal shall render the original proposal a nullity as if it were never proposed. These proposed rules, regulations, and resolutions may be withdrawn only by written request transmitted to the Chairman.</p>
<p>​(b) A Councilmember may withdraw any measure before any action has been taken by the committee to which the measure has been referred (i.e., hearing, markup, or vote).

<p>​(c) Emergency legislation shall take effect, according to its terms, either immediately or at a specific time. Pursuant to section 412(a) of the Charter (D.C. Official Code § 1-204.12), emergency legislation shall be effective law for no more than 90 days.</p>

<h3 id="reprimand.">654. REPRIMAND.</h3>
<p>​(a) A reprimand is a formal statement of the Council officially disapproving the conduct of one of its members. A reprimand shall be directed to a particular member of the Council based on a particular action or set of actions that is determined to be in violation of the Council’s Rules, law, or policy, but is considered to be not sufficiently serious to require censure. A reprimand is distinguished from censure in that it is not punishment or discipline and, therefore, does not require an investigation or hearing.</p>
<p>​(b) The Council may adopt a resolution of reprimand in the same manner as provided for the adoption of any resolution; provided, that the Councilmember who is the subject of the resolution is permitted to speak in his or her defense prior to action on the motion for adoption of the resolution. The fact that the Councilmember who is the subject of a reprimand does not choose to respond to the resolution or does not attend the meeting at which the resolution is to be adopted shall not prevent the Council from adopting the resolution; provided, that the Councilmember had actual notice of the inclusion of the resolution on the agenda and had a reasonable opportunity to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="censure.">655. CENSURE.</h3>
<p>​(a) Censure is a formal statement of the Council officially disciplining one of its members. It is a punitive action, which serves as a penalty imposed for wrongdoing, but it carries no fine or suspension of the rights of the member as an elected official. Censure should be used for cases in which the Council determines that the violation of law or policy is a serious offense. To protect the overriding principle of freedom of speech, the Council shall not impose censure on any member for the exercise of his or her First Amendment right, no matter how distasteful the expression of that right was to the Council and the District. Nothing in this rule shall be construed to prohibit the Council, as a body, from condemning and expressing its strong disapprobation.</p>
<p>(b)(1) The Council, by a 2/3rd vote of its members present and voting, may adopt a resolution of censure if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that a Councilmember took an action that amounts to a gross failure to meet the highest standards of personal and professional conduct.</p>
<p>​(2) Substantial evidence is proof that a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion or decision in favor of censure.</p>
<h3 id="expulsion.">656. EXPULSION.</h3>
<p>​(a) Expulsion is the most severe punitive action, serving as a penalty imposed for egregious wrongdoing. Expulsion results in the removal of the member. Expulsion should be used for cases in which the Council determines that the violation of law is of the most serious nature, including those violations that substantially threaten the public trust. To protect the exercise of official councilmember duties and the overriding principle of freedom of speech, the Council shall not impose expulsion on any member for the exercise of his or her First Amendment right, no matter how distasteful the expression of that right was to the Council and the District, or in the official exercise of his or her office.</p>
<p>(b)(1) The Council, by a 5/6 vote of its members, may adopt a resolution of expulsion if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that a Councilmember took an action that amounts to a gross failure to meet the highest standards of personal and professional conduct.</p>
<p>​(2) Substantial evidence is proof that a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion or decision in favor of expulsion.</p>
