	654. REPRIMAND.</H3>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">(a) A reprimand is
	a formal statement of the Council officially disapproving the
	conduct of one of its members. A reprimand shall be directed to a
	particular member of the Council based on a particular action or set
	of actions that is determined to be in violation of the Council’s
	Rules, law, or policy, but is considered to be not sufficiently
	serious to require censure. A reprimand is distinguished from
	censure in that it is not punishment or discipline and, therefore,
	does not require an investigation or hearing.</P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">(b) The Council
	may adopt a resolution of reprimand in the same manner as provided
	for the adoption of any resolution; provided, that the Councilmember
	who is the subject of the resolution is permitted to speak in his or
	her defense prior to action on the motion for adoption of the
	resolution. The fact that the Councilmember who is the subject of a
	reprimand does not choose to respond to the resolution or does not
	attend the meeting at which the resolution is to be adopted shall
	not prevent the Council from adopting the resolution; provided, that
	the Councilmember had actual notice of the inclusion of the
	resolution on the agenda and had a reasonable opportunity to attend
	the meeting.</P>
	<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__7168_930536531"></A><A NAME="_Toc368558631"></A><A NAME="_Toc343425144"></A><A NAME="_Toc343246115"></A>
	655. CENSURE.</H3>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">(a) Censure is a
	formal statement of the Council officially disciplining one of its
	members. It is a punitive action, which serves as a penalty imposed
	for wrongdoing, but it carries no fine or suspension of the rights
	of the member as an elected official. Censure should be used for
	cases in which the Council determines that the violation of law or
	policy is a serious offense. To protect the overriding principle of
	freedom of speech, the Council shall not impose censure on any
	member for the exercise of his or her First Amendment right, no
	matter how distasteful the expression of that right was to the
	Council and the District. Nothing in this rule shall be construed to
	prohibit the Council, as a body, from condemning and expressing its
	strong disapprobation.</P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">(b)(1) The
	Council, by a 2/3rd vote of its members present and voting, may
	adopt a resolution of censure if it finds, based on substantial
	evidence, that a Councilmember took an action that amounts to a
	gross failure to meet the highest standards of personal and
	professional conduct.</P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in">(2) Substantial
	evidence is proof that a reasonable person would accept as adequate
	to support a conclusion or decision in favor of censure.</P>
	<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__7170_930536531"></A><A NAME="_Toc368558632"></A><A NAME="_Toc343425145"></A><A NAME="_Toc343246116"></A>
	656. EXPULSION.</H3>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">(a) Expulsion is
	the most severe punitive action, serving as a penalty imposed for
	egregious wrongdoing. Expulsion results in the removal of the
	member. Expulsion should be used for cases in which the Council
	determines that the violation of law is of the most serious nature,
	including those violations that substantially threaten the public
	trust. To protect the exercise of official councilmember duties and
	the overriding principle of freedom of speech, the Council shall not
	impose expulsion on any member for the exercise of his or her First
	Amendment right, no matter how distasteful the expression of that
	right was to the Council and the District, or in the official
	exercise of his or her office.</P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">(b)(1) The
	Council, by a 5/6 vote of its members, may adopt a resolution of
	expulsion if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that a
	Councilmember took an action that amounts to a gross failure to meet
	the highest standards of personal and professional conduct.</P>
	<P STYLE="text-indent: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in">(2) Substantial
	evidence is proof that a reasonable person would accept as adequate
	to support a conclusion or decision in favor of expulsion.</P>
